This code uses the Pygame library to create a window with a default white background. The game loop runs continuously, listening for the "QUIT" event to close the window, and the "KEYDOWN" event to check if the "p" key is pressed. If the "p" key is pressed, the background color of the screen is changed to blue using the fill method, and the flip method is used to update the screen.
